## About Me

I love deep learning: currently focusing on multi-task learning for more robust + data-efficient generative and supervised learners.

Currently a PhD student + graduate research assistant at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I'm interested in everything [ICLR](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}-related :blush:
