## Alexander Moore

I am a data scientist + deep learning PhD candidate using concrete approaches to data science paired with transfer learning to improve accuracy of real-world chemical sensors.

Researching graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) with natural image processing techniques for improved molecular representation.

Ongoing research in computer vision, applied surface chemistry, and data synthesis emphasizing out-of-distribution learning with pretrained representations - but I'm interested in anything [ICLR](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}-related.
