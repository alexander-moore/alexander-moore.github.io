## Alex Moore's Machine Learning Research

I love machine learning and particularly unsupervised or self-supervised learning.
For my Master's degree, I did year-long independent research on inducing Cycles for GANs, which borrowed from [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/) to demonstrate that all image synthesis models may be expressed as cycles between spaces.
