## Alexander Moore

I am a data scientist + deep learning PhD candidate using concrete approaches to data science including data integrity and results summarization, as well as advanced deep learning applications to improve supervised learning outcomes for a small, challenging data set.

Ongoing research in computer vision, chemical sensors, and data synthesis emphasizing out-of-distribution learning with pretrained representations.

Currently a graduate research assistant at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I'm interested in everything [ICLR](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2021/Conference){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}-related :blush:
